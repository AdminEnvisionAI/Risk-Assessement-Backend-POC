## Employee Attrition Risk

This section assesses the risks associated with employee attrition at Infosys, focusing on the potential operational, financial, and reputational impacts of losing skilled personnel. High attrition rates can indicate underlying issues within the organization and pose significant challenges to maintaining business continuity and achieving strategic objectives.

**Elevated Employee Turnover**

Infosys faces a notable risk stemming from elevated employee attrition rates. The company has experienced significant employee departures, signaling potential instability and loss of valuable talent. The observed attrition rates suggest a concerning trend that warrants careful examination and proactive management. Increased employee turnover can disrupt ongoing projects, diminish overall productivity, and place additional strain on the remaining workforce.

**Increasing Attrition Rates**

The attrition rate at Infosys appears to be on the rise. Data indicates an increase to 14.4% in Q1 2025 (as of June 2025), compared to 14.1% in March 2025 and 12.7% in prior periods. This upward trajectory signals a potential trend that requires close monitoring and effective mitigation strategies. The increasing rate of attrition could exacerbate the negative impacts on operations, finances, and the company's reputation.

**Operational Impacts of Attrition**

High attrition poses several operational risks to Infosys. The departure of experienced employees can disrupt project timelines, reduce overall productivity, and increase the workload on remaining staff members. Loss of specialized skills and knowledge can lead to delays in project delivery and a decline in the quality of services provided. Furthermore, the need to reassign tasks and train new employees can divert resources and attention from core business activities.

**Financial Implications of Attrition**

Elevated attrition rates can have significant financial implications for Infosys. The costs associated with recruiting and training new employees can be substantial, including expenses related to advertising, interviewing, onboarding, and initial training programs. Project delays resulting from staff shortages or lack of expertise can lead to financial penalties or lost revenue opportunities. Additionally, increased labor costs may arise from the need to offer higher salaries or incentives to attract and retain talent.

**Reputational Risks Associated with Attrition**

High attrition rates can negatively impact Infosys' reputation as an employer. A perception of high turnover can deter potential job applicants and make it more challenging to attract top talent. Negative reviews or feedback from former employees can damage the company's brand image and erode trust among clients and stakeholders. Maintaining a positive employer reputation is crucial for attracting and retaining skilled professionals and ensuring the long-term success of the organization.

**Headcount Dynamics Amidst Attrition**

Despite the high attrition rate, Infosys has also experienced an improvement in total headcount, with an increase of 8,456 employees to 3.24 lakh. While this increase in overall headcount is positive, it does not negate the risks associated with high attrition. The company must ensure that new hires possess the necessary skills and experience to fill the gaps left by departing employees and maintain the quality of services provided. Furthermore, the influx of new employees requires effective onboarding and training programs to integrate them into the organization and ensure their long-term retention.
