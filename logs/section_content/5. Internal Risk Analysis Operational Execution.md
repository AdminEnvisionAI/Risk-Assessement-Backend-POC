## Talent Attrition Risk

Infosys faces a significant risk stemming from high employee attrition rates. This risk is particularly relevant given the company's reliance on skilled personnel to deliver its services and maintain its competitive edge in the IT sector. Elevated attrition can lead to operational disruptions, increased costs, and potential damage to client relationships.

**Elevated Attrition Rates:** Recent data indicates a concerning trend of increasing attrition. In Q1 2025, the attrition rate reached 14.4%. The rate stood at 14.1% in March 2025. These figures represent a notable increase compared to the previous year, where the attrition rate was 12.7%. The Q4 FY25 attrition rate was also reported at 14.1%, further highlighting the persistence of this issue. This sustained increase in attrition suggests underlying factors that require careful examination and strategic intervention.

**Impact on Operations and Finances:** The loss of experienced employees due to high attrition can have several adverse effects. It leads to increased recruitment and training costs as the company needs to replace departing employees. Project delays can occur as new hires require time to become fully productive and familiar with ongoing projects. There is also a potential impact on service quality if less experienced staff are assigned to critical tasks. The CFO's announcement of a FY26 hiring target of 20,000 suggests an attempt to counteract the impact of attrition. However, simply hiring more employees does not fully mitigate the risk, as the experience and expertise of departing employees may be difficult to replace quickly.

## Cybersecurity Risk

Cybersecurity risk represents a critical concern for Infosys, given the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyber threats targeting the IT industry. As a provider of IT services, Infosys handles sensitive data and manages critical systems for its clients, making it an attractive target for malicious actors. A successful cyberattack could have severe consequences, including financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities.

**Exposure to Diverse Cyber Threats:** Infosys, like other companies in the IT sector, is exposed to a wide range of cybersecurity threats. These include malware infections, phishing attacks, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, and sophisticated targeted attacks by state-sponsored actors. The company's global presence and interconnected IT infrastructure further increase its attack surface and vulnerability to cyber threats.

**Potential Impacts of Security Breaches:** A security breach at Infosys could have far-reaching consequences. Data breaches could compromise sensitive client information, leading to financial losses, legal liabilities, and reputational damage. System disruptions could disrupt critical business operations, impacting service delivery and revenue. Intellectual property theft could undermine Infosys' competitive advantage and innovation efforts. The company's involvement in providing cybersecurity solutions to clients suggests an awareness of these risks and a commitment to mitigating them. However, the effectiveness of these measures in preventing all types of cyberattacks remains a critical concern.
