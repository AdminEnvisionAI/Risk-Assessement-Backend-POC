# Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Currency exchange rate risk refers to the potential for financial loss or gain resulting from changes in the relative values of different currencies. For Infosys, a multinational corporation with significant operations and revenue streams spanning various countries, this risk is particularly relevant. Fluctuations in exchange rates can impact the company's revenue, expenses, profitability, and the value of its assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Effective management of currency exchange rate risk is crucial for maintaining financial stability and predictability.

## Impact of Currency Fluctuations

Infosys faces significant exposure to currency exchange rate risk due to the global nature of its operations. The company's financial performance is directly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily between the Indian Rupee (INR) and major currencies such as the US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), British Pound (GBP), and Australian Dollar (AUD). These fluctuations can lead to:

*   **Revenue Volatility:** When Infosys generates revenue in foreign currencies and converts it back to INR, the actual INR value received can vary significantly based on prevailing exchange rates. A strengthening INR relative to other currencies can reduce the INR value of foreign revenue, impacting overall revenue figures.
*   **Expense Fluctuations:** Similarly, expenses incurred in foreign currencies, such as salaries, operational costs, and vendor payments, are subject to exchange rate volatility. A weakening INR can increase the cost of these expenses when translated back to INR.
*   **Balance Sheet Impact:** Infosys holds assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Changes in exchange rates can alter the INR value of these assets and liabilities, leading to gains or losses that affect the company's balance sheet and overall financial position. The Q4 2024-2025 financial statement provides insights into assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which are directly exposed to exchange rate risk.
*   **Comprehensive Income Adjustments:** Currency translation adjustments, arising from the consolidation of foreign subsidiaries, are reflected in the statement of comprehensive income. These adjustments can significantly impact the reported comprehensive income based on currency movements.

## Economic and Market Factors

The level of currency exchange rate risk faced by Infosys is influenced by broader economic and market conditions. Factors such as economic recessions, geopolitical events, and changes in interest rates can significantly impact currency values and increase volatility.

*   **Economic Recession:** Economic downturns in key markets can lead to currency instability and reduced demand for Infosys's services. This can exacerbate the impact of currency fluctuations on the company's financial performance. The Seeking Alpha article highlights the potential for a "tough ride ahead" due to recession, layoffs, and forex risk.
*   **Global Economic Uncertainty:** Uncertainty in the global economy can drive increased volatility in currency markets, making it more challenging for Infosys to predict and manage its currency exposures.
*   **Interest Rate Movements:** Changes in interest rates by central banks can influence currency values, impacting Infosys's financial results.

## Hedging Strategies and Risk Mitigation

Infosys likely employs various hedging strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. These strategies may include:

*   **Forward Contracts:** Entering into forward contracts to lock in exchange rates for future transactions.
*   **Options:** Using currency options to provide flexibility in managing currency exposures.
*   **Natural Hedging:** Matching revenues and expenses in the same currency to reduce net exposure to currency fluctuations.
*   **Cash Flow Hedges:** Utilizing cash flow hedges to mitigate the variability in cash flows resulting from currency exchange rate changes. Disclosures related to cash flow hedges, used to mitigate currency risk, may be present in the financial statements.

The effectiveness of these hedging strategies is critical in protecting Infosys's financial performance from currency volatility. The financial statement footnotes should provide details on hedging activities.

## Financial Reporting and Compliance

As a company listed on stock exchanges, including the NYSE, Infosys is subject to stringent financial reporting and compliance requirements related to currency exchange rate risk.

*   **Form 20-F Disclosures:** Infosys is required to disclose detailed information about its currency risk exposures, hedging strategies, and the impact of currency fluctuations on its financial statements in its Form 20-F filings with the SEC.
*   **Accounting Standards:** Compliance with accounting standards such as IAS 21 (The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates) is essential for accurately translating foreign currency transactions and balances.
*   **Internal Controls:** Robust internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to ensure the accuracy and reliability of financial information related to currency exchange rate risk. The Form 20-F is related to financial reporting, so it will contain information on risks related to accounting standards, internal controls over financial reporting, and potential misstatements.

## Risk Interdependencies

Currency exchange rate risk is interconnected with other financial risks faced by Infosys.

*   **Credit Risk:** Currency fluctuations can impact the creditworthiness of customers and counterparties, potentially increasing credit risk.
*   **Liquidity Risk:** Currency volatility can affect the company's ability to access and manage liquidity, particularly in foreign currencies.
*   **Operational Risk:** Currency fluctuations can disrupt international operations and supply chains, leading to operational challenges.

## Key Risk Assessment Data

Based on available information, the following risk assessment data points are relevant:

*   **Likelihood:** High - Currency fluctuations are inherent in global business. Economic recession adds to the likelihood of volatility.
*   **Impact:** Significant - Currency fluctuations can materially impact revenue, expenses, profitability, and asset values, as suggested by the Seeking Alpha article.
*   **Severity:** Moderate to High - Depending on the magnitude of the fluctuations and the effectiveness of hedging strategies.

## Further Considerations

A comprehensive risk assessment of Infosys's currency exchange rate risk requires further analysis and monitoring:

*   **Review of Form 20-F:** A detailed review of Infosys's latest Form 20-F filing is essential to extract all risk disclosures related to currency exchange rates, financial instruments, and risk management policies.
*   **Analysis of Financial Statements:** Examination of the financial statements and footnotes for details on foreign currency exposure, hedging activities, and the impact of currency fluctuations on financial performance is crucial.
*   **Monitoring Currency Market Trends:** Continuous monitoring of exchange rates between INR and key currencies is necessary to identify potential risks and opportunities.
*   **Assessment of Economic Forecasts:** Evaluating economic forecasts for key markets helps in understanding the potential impact on currency volatility.
*   **Evaluation of Hedging Strategies:** Assessing the effectiveness of Infosys's hedging strategies in mitigating currency risk is important.
