## Technology Disruption Risks for Infosys in 2024

This risk assessment focuses on technology disruption risks relevant to Infosys in 2024, specifically data breaches and potential delays in the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These factors can significantly impact Infosys's financial stability, strategic growth, and competitive positioning.

### Data Breach Risks

Infosys is exposed to substantial risks associated with data breaches. The settlement of a data breach incident within its Business Process Management (BPM) unit for $17.5 million underscores the potential financial impact of such incidents. This settlement not only represents a direct financial loss but also indicates potential failures in existing data security protocols and incident response mechanisms. Data breaches can lead to a variety of negative consequences, including direct financial losses, legal liabilities, regulatory fines, remediation costs, and reputational damage. The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks, as highlighted in Infosys's own blog posts on data breaches, suggest that this risk is likely to intensify. Data breaches can compromise sensitive client data, intellectual property, and other confidential information, leading to a loss of trust and potentially impacting client relationships. Beyond the immediate financial impact, data breaches can trigger regulatory scrutiny under data protection laws like GDPR and CCPA, potentially leading to further fines and penalties. The interdependencies between data breach risks and reputational risks are particularly significant. A major data breach can erode customer confidence, damage brand reputation, and result in client attrition, ultimately impacting revenue and profitability.

### AI Adoption Delays

Infosys faces risks related to potential delays in the adoption of AI technologies by its clients. Concerns about the costs associated with AI implementation, as reported by Reuters, could lead to a slower-than-anticipated ramp-up of AI projects. This delay could significantly impact Infosys's revenue projections and strategic growth plans within the AI sector. The impact of this risk is moderate to high, given the increasing importance of AI in the IT services market and Infosys's strategic focus on expanding its AI capabilities. Delayed AI adoption could also affect Infosys's ability to maintain a competitive edge. As other IT service providers aggressively pursue AI-driven solutions, Infosys risks falling behind if its clients are hesitant to invest in these technologies. This could result in a loss of market share and a diminished ability to attract new clients seeking cutting-edge AI solutions. The interdependencies between AI adoption and market competitiveness are crucial. Companies that embrace AI early are likely to gain a significant advantage, and Infosys needs to ensure that its clients are not deterred by cost concerns from adopting these transformative technologies. The potential for delayed AI adoption also raises questions about the effectiveness of Infosys's strategies for demonstrating the value and ROI of AI solutions to its clients. If clients perceive the costs of AI to outweigh the benefits, they may postpone or abandon AI initiatives, directly impacting Infosys's growth trajectory in this critical area. The evolving landscape of AI technologies and the increasing pressure on IT budgets necessitate a proactive approach to addressing these potential adoption delays.
