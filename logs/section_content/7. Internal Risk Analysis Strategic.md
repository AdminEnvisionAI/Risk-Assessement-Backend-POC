## Innovation Adoption and Internal Barriers Risk

This risk category addresses the potential challenges Infosys faces related to the adoption of new technologies, particularly AI, by its clients, and the internal organizational barriers that could impede Infosys' own innovation efforts. These factors can significantly impact Infosys' revenue, competitiveness, and long-term growth prospects.

### Client Adoption of AI and Emerging Technologies

One of the primary risks is the slow or unsuccessful adoption of AI and other emerging technologies by Infosys' clients. While there is considerable interest and investment in AI, as evidenced by the statistic that 73% of enterprises have launched AI initiatives, including generative AI, a significant portion of these enterprises may not be fully realizing the anticipated business value. Specifically, only about half of the companies are seeing business value from AI initiatives. This discrepancy between adoption and value realization poses a risk to Infosys because clients who fail to see a return on their AI investments may reduce spending on Infosys' AI-related services, leading to slower revenue growth and a potential loss of market share. The exponential growth and investments in generative AI, as highlighted in Infosys' "Top 10 AI Imperatives 2024," further underscore the urgency of effectively delivering AI solutions that provide tangible business outcomes. Failure to capitalize on this trend and address the challenges clients face in adopting AI could put Infosys at a competitive disadvantage. This risk is considered to have a moderate to high severity, as failure to deliver tangible business value from AI solutions could significantly impact revenue and market position.

### Internal Barriers to Innovation

In addition to external factors influencing technology adoption, Infosys faces risks stemming from internal barriers to innovation. These internal organizational factors can impede the company's ability to adapt to emerging technologies and market trends, develop innovative solutions, and maintain a competitive edge. The inability to quickly and effectively innovate can lead to missed opportunities, slower time-to-market for new products and services, and a decline in overall competitiveness. This risk is considered to have a moderate severity, as hindered innovation can gradually erode Infosys' competitive edge and attractiveness to top talent. The likelihood of internal barriers to innovation is difficult to assess based solely on the provided search results, but it is a critical factor that Infosys must actively manage.

### Interdependencies and Correlations

The risks associated with client adoption of AI and internal barriers to innovation are closely interconnected. Internal barriers to innovation can directly exacerbate the challenges clients face in adopting AI. If Infosys struggles to innovate internally, it may be less able to develop effective AI solutions that deliver tangible value to clients. This, in turn, can further reduce client spending on Infosys' AI services and negatively impact revenue growth. Conversely, successful internal innovation can lead to the development of cutting-edge AI solutions that address client challenges and drive adoption, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and competitiveness. Infosys' "Top 10 AI Imperatives 2024" can be seen as a strategic initiative aimed at guiding both Infosys and its clients in effectively leveraging AI, which suggests a proactive approach to mitigating the "AI adoption challenge" risk. However, the effectiveness of this initiative will depend on Infosys' ability to overcome internal barriers and drive innovation.
