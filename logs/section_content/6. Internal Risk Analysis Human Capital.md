## Employee Attrition Risk

Employee attrition represents a significant risk category for Infosys, impacting operational stability, financial performance, and the company's reputation as an employer. Elevated attrition rates can lead to project disruptions, reduced productivity, increased recruitment and training costs, and difficulty in attracting and retaining skilled talent.

**Elevated Attrition Rates**

Infosys has experienced notable employee attrition, signaling potential instability and the loss of valuable expertise. The voluntary employee attrition rate reached 14.4% in June 2025, marking an increase from 14.1% in March 2025 and 12.7% earlier in the period. This upward trend in attrition rates warrants careful monitoring and analysis to identify underlying causes and implement effective retention strategies. While recent headcount additions of 2456 employees in Q2 indicate a reversal of previous trends, and the total headcount improved by 8,456 to 3.24 lakh employees, the persistent high attrition rate remains a concern. It's important to reconcile conflicting dates (2024 vs. 2025) in the data to ensure accurate trend analysis.

**Operational Impacts**

High attrition can severely impact ongoing projects and day-to-day operations. The departure of experienced employees can disrupt project timelines, reduce overall productivity, and increase the workload burden on remaining staff members. This can lead to decreased service quality, potential project delays, and increased stress on employees, which could further exacerbate attrition issues. The loss of specialized knowledge and skills can also hinder innovation and the company's ability to adapt to evolving market demands.

**Financial Impacts**

The financial implications of high attrition rates are substantial. Replacing departing employees involves significant costs related to recruitment, hiring processes, and training new personnel. These expenses can include advertising costs, agency fees, interview time, onboarding programs, and the time it takes for new hires to reach full productivity. Furthermore, increased attrition can lead to higher salary demands from existing employees seeking to compensate for increased workloads and responsibilities.

**Reputational Impacts**

Elevated attrition rates can negatively impact Infosys' reputation as an employer. A high turnover rate can signal underlying issues within the company culture, management practices, or compensation structures. This can make it more challenging to attract top talent, as potential candidates may perceive the company as an unstable or undesirable place to work. Negative online reviews, social media commentary, and industry perceptions can further damage the company's employer brand, making it more difficult to compete for skilled professionals in the IT services market.
