## Macroeconomic Risks for Ola Electric in India (2024)

This risk assessment examines the macroeconomic factors that could impact Ola Electric's operations and financial performance in India during 2024. These factors include credit risk, financial stability, the evolving electric vehicle (EV) market, and the influence of government subsidies.

**Credit Risk and Financial Stability**

Ola Electric faces moderate credit risk, as indicated by its B2 rating. This rating corresponds to a 0.231% probability of default, suggesting a tangible risk of financial distress. The company's credit quality is below the average of its peers, evidenced by a widening credit spread when compared to PURE EV™. This widening spread indicates that investors perceive Ola Electric as a riskier investment relative to at least one of its competitors, potentially increasing borrowing costs and limiting access to capital. Deteriorating creditworthiness could impede Ola Electric's ability to secure financing for expansion, research and development, or working capital needs. The B2 rating suggests that Ola Electric is vulnerable to adverse economic conditions or industry-specific challenges. Factors contributing to this credit risk could include high debt levels, negative cash flow, or a volatile market environment.

**Electric Vehicle Market and Government Subsidies**

The Indian electric vehicle (EV) market is significantly influenced by government subsidies. These subsidies can take various forms, including purchase incentives, tax breaks, and manufacturing support. Changes in subsidy policies can have a substantial impact on the demand for EVs and the competitive landscape. A reduction or elimination of subsidies could increase the upfront cost of EVs, potentially dampening consumer demand and affecting Ola Electric's sales. Conversely, an increase in subsidies could stimulate demand and benefit Ola Electric. The specific details of current subsidy programs and any anticipated changes are critical to assessing the potential impact on Ola Electric's business. The effectiveness of government subsidies in driving EV adoption depends on factors such as the size of the subsidy, the eligibility criteria, and the overall economic environment. Uncertainty surrounding government policies creates a risk for Ola Electric, as it may need to adjust its business strategies to adapt to changing incentives.
