## Financial Risks

Swiggy faces a range of financial risks stemming from its operational model, competitive landscape, and regulatory environment. These risks can impact the company's profitability, cash flow, and overall financial stability.

### Historical Losses and Negative Cash Flow

A significant financial risk for Swiggy is its history of net losses and negative cash flow since its incorporation. According to its Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP), Swiggy has recorded net losses each year since its inception and has consistently experienced negative cash flow. This indicates that the company's operational expenses and investments have exceeded its revenues, requiring external funding to sustain its operations. While incurring losses is common for growth-stage companies, prolonged negative cash flow can strain financial resources and increase dependence on external financing, potentially impacting long-term viability. However, recent reports suggest a potential turnaround, with losses narrowing in 2024, possibly driven by the surge in quick commerce.

### Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Policy

Swiggy has implemented an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Policy to manage its financial and other risks. This policy provides a framework for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks across the organization. The ERM policy encompasses several key elements:

*   **Scope and Applicability:** The policy defines the scope and applicability of the risk management framework, ensuring that all relevant areas of the business are covered.
*   **Purpose:** The policy states the objectives of the ERM framework, providing a clear understanding of its goals and intended outcomes.
*   **Roles and Responsibilities:** The policy defines the roles and responsibilities of individuals and teams involved in risk management, ensuring accountability and effective coordination.
*   **Risk Management Principles:** The policy establishes the guiding principles for risk management activities, promoting a consistent and disciplined approach to risk management.
*   **Risk Governance:** The policy defines the governance structure for risk management, ensuring oversight and accountability at the highest levels of the organization.
*   **Risk Management Approach:** The policy describes the approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks, providing a structured process for managing risks.

The existence of an ERM policy indicates Swiggy's commitment to proactively managing its risks. However, the effectiveness of the policy depends on its implementation, monitoring, and continuous improvement.
