## Credit and Operational Risks

This section assesses the credit and operational risks facing Lenskart, drawing upon available risk ratings, default probabilities, and insights into supply chain vulnerabilities.

**I. Credit Risk Assessment**

Lenskart faces a notable level of credit risk, as indicated by its B3 rating. This rating suggests a heightened susceptibility to adverse economic conditions and financial strain. The estimated probability of default, quantified at 31.62%, underscores the potential for Lenskart to face difficulties in meeting its financial obligations. While Lenskart's credit quality is considered to be on par with its peers, the deteriorating risk profile observed over the past twelve months raises concerns. This deterioration is attributed to broader market conditions and sector-specific challenges, suggesting that external factors are contributing to the increased credit risk exposure. The B3 rating reflects a non-investment grade assessment, indicating speculative credit quality and a reliance on favorable business and economic conditions to maintain solvency. Factors contributing to this credit risk may include Lenskart's debt levels, cash flow volatility, profitability margins, and overall financial stability. Close monitoring of Lenskart's financial performance and market dynamics is warranted to assess the evolving credit risk landscape.

**II. Operational Risks**

Lenskart is exposed to a range of operational risks that could disrupt its business activities and impact its financial performance. One key area of concern is supply chain risk. While the available information identifies supply chain risks as significant, it lacks specific details regarding the nature and extent of these risks. Potential supply chain vulnerabilities may include disruptions to the sourcing of raw materials (e.g., lens materials, frame components), manufacturing delays, transportation bottlenecks, and geopolitical instability affecting key suppliers. Dependence on a limited number of suppliers could amplify these risks, as could reliance on suppliers located in regions prone to natural disasters or political unrest. Inadequate inventory management practices could also exacerbate supply chain disruptions, leading to stockouts and lost sales. Further investigation is needed to fully understand Lenskart's supply chain structure, identify critical vulnerabilities, and assess the effectiveness of existing risk mitigation measures. Other operational risks may include cybersecurity threats, data breaches, IT system failures, and disruptions to e-commerce platforms.
