## Ola Electric: Operational and Business Model Risks

This risk assessment focuses on the operational and business model risks facing Ola Electric. These risks stem from the company's vertically integrated approach and potential conflicts of interest, impacting its ability to execute its strategy and maintain investor confidence.

**Vertically Integrated Business Model Risks**

Ola Electric operates a vertically integrated business model encompassing research and development, manufacturing, supply chain management, sales, service, and charging infrastructure development. While this model offers potential advantages such as greater control over the value chain and improved efficiency, it also introduces significant operational and financial risks. Managing all these functions internally demands substantial capital investment across various stages, specialized expertise in diverse domains, and seamless coordination across different departments. The complexity of this integrated approach increases the potential for disruptions. Failure in any single area, such as supply chain bottlenecks, manufacturing defects, or inadequate charging infrastructure, can disrupt the entire value chain, leading to delays, increased costs, and customer dissatisfaction. The company's ability to effectively manage this complexity will be critical to its success.

**Conflict of Interest Risks**

Ambit Capital and its affiliates may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of their report regarding Ola Electric. This conflict of interest presents a risk for investors who rely on such reports for decision-making, as the information may be biased or incomplete. Investors need to be aware of potential conflicts of interest when evaluating research reports and seek independent sources of information to make informed decisions.
