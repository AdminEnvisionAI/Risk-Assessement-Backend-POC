## Data Privacy and Compliance Risk

This risk category encompasses the potential for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to violate data privacy laws, regulations, and standards, leading to financial penalties, reputational damage, legal liabilities, and loss of customer trust. It includes non-compliance with established regulations like GDPR and CCPA, as well as emerging challenges related to new technologies like Generative AI.

### GDPR and CCPA Non-Compliance

Failure to adhere to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) poses a significant risk to TCS. GDPR mandates the protection of personal data and privacy of EU citizens, while CCPA grants California consumers extensive rights over their personal information held by businesses. Non-compliance can result in substantial financial fines, reputational damage impacting brand image and customer trust, and potential customer attrition as clients seek service providers with stronger data protection practices. The likelihood of non-compliance is directly related to the effectiveness of TCS's data protection strategies and the strength of its IT support infrastructure. The impact of non-compliance spans financial, reputational, and customer retention aspects, making it a critical risk factor.

### Generative AI Privacy Risks

The increasing adoption of generative AI technologies introduces new and complex data privacy and regulatory compliance challenges for TCS. These challenges stem from the unique data handling practices associated with AI, including data collection, storage, processing, and usage. The severity of these risks depends on the specific AI applications deployed, the sensitivity of the data involved, and the robustness of implemented safeguards. The regulatory landscape surrounding AI is still evolving, creating uncertainty and requiring TCS to proactively monitor and adapt to new guidelines and legal requirements. TCS aims to be a "perpetually adaptive enterprise" to evolve continuously and confidently in a world of constant change.

### Increasing Data Privacy Regulations

The global landscape of data privacy regulations is becoming increasingly complex and stringent. This trend necessitates continuous monitoring and adaptation by TCS to maintain compliance across all jurisdictions in which it operates. The proliferation of new regulations and amendments to existing laws requires ongoing investment in compliance resources, training, and technology to ensure adherence. Failure to keep pace with these evolving requirements can expose TCS to increased legal and financial risks.

### IT Support and Data Compliance Interdependency

Effective IT support is crucial for maintaining GDPR and CCPA compliance. Robust IT infrastructure and security measures are essential for protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access, breaches, and cyberattacks. Deficiencies in IT support can directly increase the risk of data privacy violations and non-compliance. This interdependency highlights the need for a holistic approach to data privacy and compliance, integrating IT security, data governance, and legal expertise.

### Generative AI and Data Privacy Interdependency

The use of generative AI can amplify the risk of data privacy breaches if appropriate safeguards are not implemented. AI algorithms often require large datasets for training, potentially involving the processing of sensitive personal information. Without adequate data anonymization, access controls, and security measures, the use of AI can increase the likelihood of data breaches and non-compliance with privacy regulations. This interdependency underscores the importance of integrating data privacy considerations into the development and deployment of AI systems.
