## Regulatory and Economic Risks for Swiggy

This risk assessment focuses on the regulatory challenges facing Swiggy and the potential impact of the economic slowdown in India on its operations. These factors could significantly affect Swiggy's profitability, market position, and long-term sustainability.

### Antitrust and Competition Risks

Swiggy faces increasing regulatory scrutiny regarding potential anti-competitive practices. Recent reports indicate that Swiggy, along with Zomato, may have breached competition laws in India. Furthermore, an Indian retail group is actively seeking an antitrust probe into quick commerce companies, including Swiggy, Blinkit, and Zepto. This heightened regulatory attention poses a significant risk to Swiggy's operations and business model.

The potential impacts of these antitrust concerns are substantial. Swiggy could face significant fines and penalties if found in violation of competition laws. Regulatory bodies may impose restrictions on its business practices, potentially limiting its ability to compete effectively in the market. Moreover, such investigations and adverse findings can severely damage Swiggy's reputation, leading to a loss of customer trust and market share.

Key risk indicators for this category include an increase in regulatory investigations, legal challenges from competitors alleging anti-competitive behavior, and any adverse findings or rulings by competition authorities. These indicators should be closely monitored to assess the evolving regulatory landscape and its potential impact on Swiggy.

### Economic Slowdown Risks

The economic slowdown in India presents a significant challenge to Swiggy's financial performance. Recent reports indicate that Swiggy has experienced a wider quarterly loss due to a spike in marketing costs. This suggests that the company is facing increased competition and must invest more heavily in marketing to maintain its market share during the economic downturn.

The potential impacts of the economic slowdown are multifaceted. Reduced consumer spending and discretionary income can lead to lower order volumes and revenue growth for Swiggy. Increased marketing expenses to attract and retain customers can further erode profitability. The company may face pressure to cut costs, potentially affecting service quality and employee morale. Furthermore, an economic slowdown can make it more difficult for Swiggy to raise capital for expansion and investment.

Key risk indicators for this category include declining revenue growth, increasing marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue, widening losses, and any difficulty in securing funding. These indicators should be closely monitored to assess the impact of the economic slowdown on Swiggy's financial health and operational performance.
