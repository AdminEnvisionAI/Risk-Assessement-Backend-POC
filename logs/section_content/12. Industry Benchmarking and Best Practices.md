## Enterprise Risk Management

This section assesses Infosys' approach to enterprise risk management (ERM), focusing on the formalization of risk management policies and frameworks. A robust ERM framework is crucial for identifying, evaluating, and mitigating risks that could impact the company's strategic objectives, financial performance, and overall operations.

**Formalized ERM Policy**

Infosys has established a formal Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Policy, demonstrating a commitment to structured risk management practices. The ERM Policy serves as a guiding document that outlines the principles, processes, and responsibilities for managing risks across the organization. The policy was amended and effective as of April 18, 2024, indicating a recent update and ongoing attention to risk management practices. The existence of a formalized ERM policy suggests a proactive approach to risk management, enabling Infosys to systematically identify, assess, and respond to potential threats and opportunities.

**Risk Management Maturity & Benchmarking**

While Infosys has a formalized ERM policy, the available search results lack specific details on the maturity level of its risk management framework and how it compares to industry peers. Benchmarking risk management maturity against competitors and industry best practices is essential for identifying areas for improvement and ensuring the effectiveness of risk management efforts. Without this comparative analysis, it is challenging to determine the relative strength of Infosys' risk management capabilities.

**Blockchain-Based Risk Management**

One search result mentions "Blockchain-Based Risk Management in Cross-Border Data Supply...". If Infosys is involved in cross-border data supply activities, blockchain technology could be leveraged to enhance risk management in this area. Blockchain's inherent security and transparency features can help mitigate risks related to data integrity, security, and compliance in cross-border data flows. However, further investigation is required to determine the extent of Infosys' involvement in cross-border data supply and the potential application of blockchain-based risk management solutions.
